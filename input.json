The primary focus of the .NET Code Review is to \n\ncheck how well the code conforms to the recommended best practices in \n\nthe areas of design, security, and performance. The .NET Code Review \n\ncan be further tailored to focus on certain feature areas such as ASP.NET, \n\nMVC, ADO.NET, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), Microsoft \n\nAzure, and other .NET developer and web technologies. \n\nThis service can delivered onsite or remote. Based on the scoping and \n\nengagement sizing the duration can be 2,4, or 5 days. \n\nEngagement Sizing\nThe .NET Code Review is sized to the complexity of your application using \n\nthe following criteria. Note: Additional days may be needed based on \n\nviolations found or lack of adherence to proper coding practices. \n\nPrerequisites\n\nDiscovery must be completed for an application before the .NET Code \n\nReview to determine priorities and goals for the review and obtain all \n\nnecessary application components. Application stakeholders need to be \n\navailable for consultation during the duration of the code review.\n\nRecommendations to \n\nremediate the code to \n\nadhere to the best \n\npractices will be provided \n\nin a detailed report.\n\nTier Lines of code Duration\n\nTier 1 Up to 5000 2 days\n\nTier 2 5001 - 15000 4 days\n\nTier 3 15001 - 20000 5 days\n\nAdd-on Ad-hoc 1 day\n\n\n\nFor more information about Consulting and Support solutions from Microsoft, contact your \n\nMicrosoft Services representative or visit www.microsoft.com/services\n\nHow the Service Works\nThe .NET Code Review starts with a discovery phase which ensures:\n\n• Goals and priority areas for the review are established\n\n• Application source code and components are obtained and \n\nvalidated.\n\n• Scope and duration for the review were determined correctly.\n\n• Next steps and timelines are outlined for the next phase.\n\nNote: Reviews are usually scoped for a week or less, but larger \n\napplications are supported via multiple code review engagements.\n\nAfter the discovery phase is completed, the source code will be \n\nreviewed for adherence to best practices related to design, security, \n\nand performance. When the review is completed, the Microsoft \n\nEngineer will meet you to review the findings, answer questions, and \n\nassist with determining the next steps.\n\nResources will be available to answer follow-up questions and assist \n\nwith remediating the code up to 3 days after the report is delivered. \n\nHighlights\n\n• Discovery of the application’s components and features to be \n\nincluded in the code review ensure a manageable amount of target \n\ncode\n\n• Typically focus on up to 3 application components or features \n\nidentified during discovery for more in depth analysis\n\n• A combination of automated and manual inspection will be done to \n\nisolate violations of Microsoft best practices in the source code\n\n• Recommendations to remediate the code will be provided in a \n\ndetailed report\n\nDeliverables\n\n• A detailed report with the review findings and recommendations for \n\nremediation \n\nExpert Microsoft developer \n\nresources provide \n\nadditional guidance during \n\nremediation of the code.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nThis service is targeted at \n\nDevelopment and Quality \n\nAssurance teams that are \n\nresponsible for the \n\ndevelopment or stabilization \n\nphases of their product \n\ndevelopment lifecycle. \n\nImportant Note: Code \n\nreviews focus on identifying \n\ncode that is not compliant with \n\ndocumented best practices. A \n\ncode review is not a substitute \n\nfor thorough and well-\n\nexecuted testing and \n\ndebugging of an application.\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/services\n\n"
